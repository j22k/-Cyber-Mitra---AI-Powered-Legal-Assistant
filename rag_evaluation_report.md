## Interpretation

### Retrieval Quality
Good retrieval performance. The system retrieves most relevant documents but with some irrelevant results.

### Answer Quality
Acceptable answer relevance, but answers may be missing important details or context.

### Performance Characteristics
System latency (53.53s) is high. Consider optimizing the retrieval process or using a faster LLM.
The system uses an average of 4.0 sources per query.

## Recommendations

- Improve answer completeness by providing more context to the LLM or using a more capable model.
- Reduce latency by optimizing the retrieval process or using a faster LLM implementation.
